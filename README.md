# ðŸ§© Molo Node

This is the official node implementation for the **UseMolo** decentralized torrent network.

UseMolo Nodes help distribute and seed content in a censorship-resistant and wallet-authenticated environment. By running a Molo Node, you contribute storage and bandwidth to the network, while staying in control of your node's identity and operations.
